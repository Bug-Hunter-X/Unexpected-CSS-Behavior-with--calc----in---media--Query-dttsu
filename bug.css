The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the usage of the `calc()` function within the `@media` query. This can lead to unexpected behavior or rendering issues in different viewport sizes.  The issue stems from improper handling of units within the calculation, resulting in syntax errors.

```css
@media (max-width: calc(100vw - 100px))
{
  .element {
    width: 50%;
  }
}
```
